              Stay away from those people who try to disparage your ambitions.
              Small minds will always do that, but great minds will give you a
              feeling that you can become great too.

              Success is peace of mind, which is a direct result of
              self-satisfaction in knowing you made the effort to become the
              best of which you are capable.

            Teamwork is the ability to work together toward a common vision. The
            ability to direct individual accomplishments toward organizational
            objectives. It is the fuel that allows common people to attain
            uncommon results. Individual commitment to a group effortâ€”that is
            what makes a team work, a company work, a society work, a
            civilisation work.
